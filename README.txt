Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

This project was done on VSCode in a Jupyter Notebook. The code file can de accessed through the following link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IXCu_7TiQmvTtNRQvL8FsVP3l_VVMkmu/view?usp=share_link

The following libraries were used in the production of this file and should be installed:
sklearn
mlrose_hiive
np
time
matplotlib.pyplot


The code is split into 3 sections: 
Fitness and Fevals by Iteration - switch between problems by changing the prob variable.
Fitness and Runtime by Problem Size - switch between problems by changing the prob2 variable.
Neural Network Fitting - each model cooresponds with a different algorithm. Run each model to accuracy and loss functions.
